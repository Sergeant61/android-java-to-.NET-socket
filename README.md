# android-java-to-cs-socket

Simple client in Java that transfers a single file over a wireless network to an IP:Port running over a simple socket to the server which uses C#.
The client currently clicks a photo using the camera intent.

## Notes:

 - The client transfers a single photograph right now after compressing and resizing. This can be changed as required
 - The server IP and port are hard coded, which can be changed, as well as the file in which it is stored.
